Here is the algorithm I used to complete the Codewars.com 3KYU (Level 3) Screen Locking Patterns problem.

Coding this algorithm taught me:

- Some new/unique python functionalities (Shallow copying arrays)
- How to work with and manage large data structures
- Optimizing my code

My algorithm is saved in this same directory as: screen_locking_pattern.py
